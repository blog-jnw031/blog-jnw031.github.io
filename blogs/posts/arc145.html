    <h1 class="title">ARC 145</h1>
    <p>This morning, I participated in AtCoder Regular Contest 145 and here's my solutions and feelings about the contest.</p>
    
    <h1>A</h1>
    <p><a href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc145/tasks/arc145_a">Problem Link</a>.</p>
    <p>It takes me a lot of time to find the properties of the problem, and I finally found that if the last letter is \(\texttt{A}\), I can change all the previous letters to \(\texttt{ABB...B}\) to make it a palindrome. If both the first and the last letter is \(\texttt{B}\), I can change the string \(\texttt{B****B}\) to \(\texttt{BAA...AB}\) and it's also a palindrome.</p>
    <p>Therefore, the only impossible case is when \(S_1=\texttt{A}\) and \(S_n=\texttt{B}\), but I missed a special case so I got a penalty: when \(n=2\), the answer is yes if and only if \(S_1=S_2\).</p>

    <h1>B</h1>
    <p><a href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc145/tasks/arc145_b">Problem Link</a>.</p>
    <p>I thought the answer when \(a\geq n\) and \(a\ < b\) is \[b\left(\left\lfloor\frac{n+1}{a}\right\rfloor+1\right)+\min\{\left(n+1\right)\bmod a,b\}\] and I thought it was fake, after the end of the contest, I sent a post for help and found that I accidently wrote an \(\texttt{if}\) instead of \(\texttt{else if}\), and my formula is correct. </p>

    <h1>C</h1>
    <p><a href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc145/tasks/arc145_c">Problem Link</a>.</p>
    <p>I found a property in the contest that for each \(2\nmid x\), \(x\) must match \(x+1\), and I was stucked in calculating the number of ways to satisfy it.</p>
